Hi, I'm Lucien, a junior at the University of California, San Diego studying Probability & Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Economics.

I am interested in pursuing a careeer in data science/analytics and am constantly looking for new ways to put my skills to the test and develop them further.

Currently I am interning with the City of San Diego, in the Information Technology department where I work to improve digital equity within the underserved community. My most recent project involves using Python, Power BI, and ArcGIS to map out areas of San Diego that require critical infrastructure to improve broadband access for San Diegans. 

In the summer of 2024, I will be interning under the Data Science team at Mars Petcare.
