Hi, I'm Lucien, a Math-Economics student at the University of California, San Diego.

I am interested in pursuing a careeer in data science and am constantly looking for new ways to put my skills to the test and develop them.

Currently I am interning with the City of San Diego, in the Information Technology department where I work to improve digital equity within the underserved community.
