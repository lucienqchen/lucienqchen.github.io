Hi, I'm Lucien, a sophomore at the University of California, San Diego studying Probability & Statistics and Data Science.

I am interested in pursuing a careeer in data science/analytics and am constantly looking for new ways to put my skills to the test and develop them further.

Currently I am interning with the City of San Diego, in the Information Technology department where I work to improve digital equity within the underserved community.
