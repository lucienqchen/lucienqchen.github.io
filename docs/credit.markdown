# But... What is Credit?

by Lucien Chen

In the realm of personal finance, one of the most pivotal concepts you will hear about is credit. Your creditworthiness plays a large role in determining your ability to buy a home, apply for loans, and sometimes even when applying for jobs. But what exactly is credit? And why is is so crucial to your financial health? In this blog post, I address these questions and hopefully you will be able to walk away with an understanding of the essentials of credit and how to effectively manage it.

## What is Credit?

Fundamentally, credit is the trust that a borrower forms with a lender that allows them to lend out money with the expectation of repayment in the future. This repayment will typically, but not always include the original amount (also known as the principal) plus accrued interest. Credit can take on various forms, including:

1. Credit Cards: revolving lines of credit that allow you to borrow up to a limit

2. Loans: lump sums that accrue interest over time, includes personal loans, auto loans, student loans, mortages, etc.

3. Lines of Credit: revolving loans, typically collateralized or secured by some asset, like your home for example

## Key Terminology

Here are some important terms you should know regarding credit:

1. Credit Report: a record of your credit history, that is, a record of your borrowing and repayment; it will typically include information about your accounts, payment history and outstanding balances

2. Credit Score: a number ranging from 300 to 850 that represents your creditworthiness to lendors; your score is calculated based a variety of factors including payment history, credit utilization, average age of accounts, recent inquiries, etc.

3. Interest Rates: effectively the cost of borrowing money, typically expressed as APR or annual percentage rate

## Building & Managing Your Credit

Now that you're more familiar with what credit is, let's talk about some strategies to effectively build and manage it.

My personal opinion is that credit cards are one of the easiest ways to start building credit. The process is relatively frictionless as all you need to do is start paying for your purchases with your credit card and pay your balance off on time every month. **Important**: Treat your credit card as if it were a debit card. Do **NOT** spend money you don't have.

An alternative way to start building credit is to become an authorized user of someone who has good credit. The way this works is they will add you as an AU through their financial institution, and that institution will start reporting to the credit bureaus on your behalf. **Important**: The cardholder still assumes responsibility for all purchases made on the card.

Once you have some forms of creidt, here are some ways you can increase your credit score:

1. Paying on Time: Paying your bills on time, consistently is one of the most significant factors that affect your credit score. If you do this, your score is sure to increase over time.

2. Maintain a Low Credit Utilization: In plain English, this means you want to keep credit card balances low relative to your credit limits. Rule of Thumb is < 30%.

3. Limit Hard Inquiries: Typically, when you apply for a credit card, you will receive a hard inquiry on your credit report. This is basically a formal notice to the credit bureaus that you are seeking credit. Having a lot of these within a relatively short timeframe looks bad as it makes you seem desparate for credit so try to avoid this if possible.

## Conclusion:

Credit is one of the most important parts of personal finances and can have significant impacts on your life. Through understanding how credit works and steps you can take to manage it effectively, you can improve your financial wellness and work toward achieving your financial goals.
