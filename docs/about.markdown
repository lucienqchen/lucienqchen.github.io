Hi, my name is Lucien and I am a sophomore studying Math, Economics & Data Science at the University of California San Diego. I am passionate about using data to optimize processes, create valuable insights, and make informed decisions. I hope to pursue a career in Financial Technology or the Non-profit sector.
